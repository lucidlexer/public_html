            <p>  After working in embedded systems for a while, I thought I'd take my head
            out of the wonderful world of C and C++ to get a taste of the web.  This site 
            serves as a personal project in educating myself with different web technologies.

            <p>
            It doesn't look like too much right now, but I'll be adding more and more as the 
            weeks go on and on.  Hold on tight, and...
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Please, Enjoy your stay.
